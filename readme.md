# GoodReads

## What is the purpose of the site?
- Help people find books to read and give them a platform to share it
- Three goals: users' goals, GR's goals, and now Amazon's goals ()
- why is the about page and their story not being shared?
- Connect with or streamline to Amazon's service and experience. If Amazon has streamlined purchases, why not streamline book discovery?
- Connect with Amazon incrementally.
- Encourage people to read more and give them incentives

## What are the goals of the redesign?
1. Find out what the goals of the user are and design around that
2. Focus down what the functions of the site are in order to facilitate the user's experience
3. Add an element of delight for the user to reinforce GR's values and keep users using the site and service


## SWOT
### Strengths
- people enjoy tracking their books
- many options for users and authors
- strong, vast database
- despite accessibility and design, lots of users who are committed
- highest number of features/capabilities than most book-related sites

### Weaknesses
- user base falls off after a while (typical with a lot of social media)
- not a big push on wanting to read more / types of users who are going to get more out of it are the ones who read a lot
- overwhelming for a first-time user because there are so many features and a lot of content
- not obvious or intuitive
- users not feeling connected to others or to service
- what if you don't have any friends? How do you get friends?
- two step method to add friends
- no clear distinction between "follow" and "friend", the latter which includes follow.
- by the time the book is done, user could forgot about service
- design doesn't look "current" or "trendy"
- nothing makes them preferable over something else like Amazon, notepad
- Amazon relationship isn't made clear


### Opportunity
- gamifying or engaging the user through challenges
- celebrity or famous personality endorsement could be a feature
- GR as a brand, a living, breathing brand.
- bring delight
- mascot? librarian? bookworm? bookmark? (bookmarq)
- improving accessibility (disability, literacy (from both a language barrier and self-development/education perspective), poverty line/income, device or internet availability/capability)
- connect with public libraries and bookstores (geo location of books even!)
- recommendations on a more consistent basis
- book clubs
- text and/or other ways to reach users 
- find sub-genres or more info on the "classics" or their authors
- reaching a younger demographic

### Threats
- reader drop off rate can continue or get worse 
- more distractions
- competitors designing a more fluid experience
- competitors focus on ebooks and bridge/streamline experience with ebook readers
- Amazon could completely kill the niche market that is GR. 
- more established social network could kill the service (eg. Apple, Facebook, etc)



## How do we intend to meet the goals through design
- Give the text room to breathe to improve the reading experience, and call out important actions on the site
- Simplify layout, so content and key features are easy to find
- Bring in more hierarchy so the user can figure out the actions of the app
